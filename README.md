Bitcoin price prediction using Bayesian Regression

In this project, I was tasked with predicting the price variations of bitcoin,a virtual cryptographic currency. These predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. 
To make these predictions, I had to familiarize myslef with a machine learning technique, Bayesian Regression, and implement this technique in Python.
